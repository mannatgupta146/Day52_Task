# Day 52 Task | Cohort 2.0

This project is my **Day 50 Task**, where I built a fully interactive **Instagram-style Reels UI** using **HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript**.  
The app displays a vertical feed of reels, complete with autoplay videos, profile info, follow button, like/comment/share actions, and scroll-snap functionality to switch reels smoothly.

This task helped me understand DOM creation using data arrays, scroll snapping, positioning UI elements on top of videos, and recreating real social-media interactions using web technologies.


## 🎥 Demo  
Here is a quick demo of the project:

## 📌 About the Day 50 Task  
Day 50 focused on building a **short-video scrolling feed**, similar to Instagram Reels / YouTube Shorts. I learned how to:

- Create UI dynamically using JavaScript template literals  
- Use autoplay, loop, muted video attributes  
- Overlay profile info, actions, and descriptions on videos  
- Implement **scroll-snap** for reel-style navigation  
- Use SCSS nesting to keep styles clean and structured  
- Manage like/follow states with objects  
- Build a responsive, centered mobile-style reel layout  


## ✨ Task Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎬 **Autoplay Reels** | Each video plays automatically and loops. |
| 👤 **Profile Overlay** | Username, DP, and follow button displayed on each reel. |
| ❤️ **Interactive Buttons** | Like, comment, and share counters with icons. |
| 🔄 **Dynamic Rendering** | All reels are generated from a JavaScript array. |
| 📝 **Custom Descriptions** | Each reel has its unique caption. |
| 🎚️ **Scroll-Snap Feed** | Smooth vertical snapping like Instagram reels. |
| 🎨 **SCSS Styling** | Clean nested SCSS structure. |
| 📱 **Mobile UI Layout** | Reels layout similar to real short-video apps. |


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure  
- **SCSS** – Styling, layout, nesting  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Dynamic rendering & logic  
- **Remix Icons** – Action icons  
- **VS Code** – Development environment  
- **MP4 Files** – Reel videos  


## 📖 Learning Outcome  

By completing this task, I learned:

- How to dynamically build UI using JavaScript arrays  
- How the HTML `<video>` element handles auto-playing content  
- How scroll-snap works for vertical feed navigation  
- How to position multiple layers on videos using absolute positioning  
- How to structure large CSS files using SCSS nesting  
- How interactive UI states (likes, follows) are handled  
- How modern reel/short-video feeds are built in real applications  

This task strengthened my understanding of scroll interactions, dynamic UI creation, video handling, and SCSS structuring.

## 🌟 Acknowledgement  

This **Day 50 task** helped me understand how popular apps like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts build their reel interfaces.  
Thank you to **Cohort 2.0** for providing fun, challenging, and practical projects that help me grow as a developer.
